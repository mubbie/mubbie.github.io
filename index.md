My name is Mubarak Idoko. I go by *mubbie*.

I live in Seattle, Washington, and I am an engineer at Microsoft. I hope to build interesting technologies before I leave the planet. 

Apart from that, and rather vaguely, I am striving to: 
- Become better every day ğŸª´
- Solve interesting problems ğŸ’¡
- Take on the world with a big smile on my face ğŸ˜€

I am also currently working on [Lena](https://lena.africa/)

Here, I share some of my thoughts, ideas, and others.

You are welcome.
