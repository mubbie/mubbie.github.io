My name is Mubarak Idoko. I go by *mubbie*.

I live in Seattle, Washington, and I am an engineer at Microsoft. Before I leave this planet, I hope to build fascinating tools and technologies. My current approach is to become a Security Engineer, seasoned entrepreneur, and business leader.

Apart from that, and rather vaguely, I am striving to: 
- Become better every day ðŸª´
- Solve interesting problems ðŸ’¡
- Take on the world with a big smile on my face ðŸ˜€

I am also currently working on [Lena](https://lena.africa/)

Here, I share some of my thoughts, ideas, learnings, and more.

Welcome.
