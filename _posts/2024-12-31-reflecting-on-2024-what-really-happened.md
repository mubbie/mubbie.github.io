## Introduction

I‚Äôll admit it‚ÄîI‚Äôm not the best at telling my own story. While I thrive at spotlighting the work of others, sharing my own journey often feels clumsy or incomplete. But as 2024 ends, I‚Äôm challenging myself to pause, reflect, and celebrate the big and small moments that defined my year.  

Join me as I recount the highlights, setbacks, and lessons that made 2024 unforgettable. In the paragraphs ahead, I‚Äôll take you through my adventures in sports and physical activity, professional milestones, relationships, community-building, and a few personal favorites that shaped my year. Finally, I‚Äôll share what I look forward to as we enter 2025. Let‚Äôs dive into the year that was!

## Physical Activity: Lifting Weights, Chasing Wins, and The Art of Running in the Rain

On a chilly, grey January 1st, 2024, I laced up my running shoes and stepped out into the Seattle mist for a one-mile run. My goal for the year was simple: run one mile every day (except Saturdays, with a 5K on Sundays) and hit or surpass 366 miles by year‚Äôs end. If I stuck with it, I figured I‚Äôd build the strength and consistency to start training for a half marathon by 2026.

So, how did it go? Well, I didn‚Äôt quite make 366 miles. Instead, I logged just over 300‚Äîthanks to a 12-week break after a stress fracture in my knee from soccer. But here‚Äôs the surprising part: despite the setback, I completed a grueling half marathon. And not just any race‚Äîit was a [NorthWest Trail Run](https://nwtrailruns.com/), complete with relentless rain, slick mud, freezing cold, and punishing elevation changes. With no proper training, I finished at a 10:30/mi pace, running straight through and stopping only four times for quick energy gels. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but I embraced the challenge and loved every bit of it. Beyond that, I hit a few personal running milestones that I‚Äôm proud of: a best 5K time of 28:08 and my fastest average pace of 7:14/mi over a two-mile run.

What made me happiest was seeing some of my friends‚Äîwho weren‚Äôt big on running‚Äîjoin me. A few had teased me about ‚Äúchasing nothing,‚Äù so watching them embrace the joys and inevitable aches of running was incredibly rewarding. I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased‚Äîthey finally get it. üòå

Running wasn‚Äôt the only activity that kept me moving this year. Soccer played a big role, too. I joined a Seattle Recreational Adult League team in late 2023, holding down the center forward position throughout 2024. Watching our team grow from underdogs to contenders by December was exhilarating. I also joined a flag football team for the fall season‚Äîa completely new sport for me. Not only did I learn the game, but I started following it on TV‚Äîsomething my younger self would never have believed! We made it to the playoffs, narrowly missing the semifinals, but the friendships and memories made it all worth it.

One standout moment was a charity soccer match organized by a friend to raise funds for kids in Nigeria to attend school. It was 90 minutes of fierce competition, vibrant Afrobeats, and playful trash-talking‚Äîan unforgettable blend of fun and purpose. It inspired me, and I hope to participate in more activities like this in 2025 that combine enjoyment with a larger impact.

I also discovered pickleball, a fantastic (and forgiving) alternative to tennis, which still challenges me. Dancing was another unexpected highlight. I took classes in Bachata, Afrobeats and Amapiano, picking up a few moves to show off at parties and dance socials. Dancing brought joy, rhythm, and a sense of vibrancy to my year. At the gym, I focused on powerlifting with the [StrongLifts 5x5 program](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/), emphasizing core lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, barbell rows, and overhead presses. This classic regimen, utilized by legends like [Reg Park](https://gymtalk.com/reg-park-5x5-routine/) and [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://muscleevo.net/did-arnold-do-5x5/), was a cornerstone of my training, with a clear focus on developing strength.

Toward the end of the year, I shifted to a more hypertrophy-focused program‚Äî[Marcus Filly's Functional Bodybuilding](https://functional-bodybuilding.com/)‚Äîwhich combines strength training with conditioning to reduce burnout and minimize the risk of injury. I got this recommendation from a [friend](https://www.instagram.com/umacodes/), and it‚Äôs been a refreshing change thus far. I'll continue with it in 2025 and potentially explore StrongLifts' Hypertrophy focused workout program, the [Stronglifts 5√ó5 Plus: Upper-body Hypertrophy Program](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/plus/).

Finally, there was skydiving. To celebrate my birthday, I took my first jump‚Äîa thrilling mix of exhilaration and sheer terror. Every second was unforgettable, and I loved it more than I could have imagined. I‚Äôm already planning at least two jumps in 2025 (it‚Äôs bloody expensive, though‚Äîholla at me if you know where to get discounts) and hope to convince a few friends to join me (though they‚Äôre not exactly eager‚Äîyet). Who knows? Maybe one day, I‚Äôll even work toward earning a skydiving license.

Amid all this activity, my trusty watch tells me I logged 4,396,500 steps‚Äîan average of over 12,000 steps a day. But beyond the stats, 2024 reminded me of the profound connection between physical movement and mental clarity. Exercise wasn‚Äôt just a way to stay fit; it became my lifeline, a creative fuel, and the spark that kept me alive and more engaged with the world.

## Professional Life: Putting Out Fires, Building Dreams, and Learning Through the Grind

The start of 2024 was a whirlwind of engineering work as I helped tackle fires at my job. Our company had been caught in the crosshairs of a large-scale nation-state hack, leaving critical systems vulnerable. The team worked tirelessly to fortify our systems, ensuring resilience against future attacks. The work was both challenging and rewarding, though it often came at a personal cost. There were nights when I stayed in the office until ungodly hours, running on fumes and pushing through burnout. My roommates frequently teased me about my relentless work ethic, and they weren‚Äôt wrong‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt great for my well-being. Still, I genuinely enjoyed the intensity and the tangible impact of the work. By the end of the fiscal year, my efforts were recognized with high commendations from my manager and a well-earned promotion. In 2025, I‚Äôm determined to continue working hard but with a healthier balance, prioritizing sleep, consistent meals, and sustainable habits, and focus to avoid the burnout I experienced this year.

Since stepping into my new role, I‚Äôve faced a different kind of challenge: maintaining the same level of impact. As I feared, it sometimes feels like I‚Äôve set an impossibly high bar with my earlier efforts, leaving me struggling to keep up. But growth often stems from discomfort, and I‚Äôm embracing the learning curve, determined to evolve and improve each day.

Beyond my 9-to-5, I launched this blog‚Äîa space to explore and share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings. This year, I wrote on various topics, including technology, sports, and politics. Writing has become my go-to method for deepening my understanding; explaining concepts to others not only helps me retain what I learn but also clarifies my thinking. In 2025, I‚Äôm eager to expand my horizons, learn even more, and turn those lessons into an even greater number of blog posts than in 2024. I hope you‚Äôll be part of this journey, offering your insights and ideas along the way.

One of my personal highlights this year was finally passing my professional engineering exams after an earlier stumble. This milestone, combined with reading more books than ever before and exploring diverse, often uncomfortable ideas, made 2024 a deep dive into knowledge. The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don‚Äôt know‚Äîa humbling yet invigorating revelation. My goal for 2025 is simple: to guzzle up as much knowledge and learning as possible.

Much of my year revolved around Lena, the startup I‚Äôve been building with an incredible team. Lena‚Äôs mission is ambitious yet deeply needed: to transform education through low-tech learning and school management solutions, starting with schools in Nigeria. While we aimed to launch in 2024, we pushed the timeline to 2025. We weren‚Äôt satisfied that we had built something truly impactful for the schools we want to serve.

</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

This setback wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîespecially with our runway shrinking fast. But perseverance paid off. Representing the team, I pitched Lena at [Founders Live](https://www.founderslive.com/prime-time-pitch-challenge) and [secured $5,000 in funding](https://www.founderslive.com/the-feed-container/prime-time-2024-wrap-up). Thanks to our disciplined financial management, this funding buys us several months to refine our work. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of how the team has grown this year, with every member stepping up and delivering their best.

I can‚Äôt wait to see Lena make its mark, helping students in Nigeria and beyond unlock their potential. Our dream is to start with Nigeria, expand across Africa, and eventually serve communities worldwide that need accessible, low-tech educational tools. You can learn more about Lena and our vision on our [website](https://lena.africa/). 2024 was a year of hard lessons and big dreams for Lena, and 2025 promises to be the year we truly take flight.

## Relationships and Community: Strengthening Bonds, Building Bridges, and Learning from Mistakes

After graduating college, one of my biggest fears was that it would be incredibly challenging to make and maintain friendships in the so-called ‚Äúreal world.‚Äù Thankfully, that hasn‚Äôt been entirely true. While I miss the ease of meeting and connecting with people in college, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the deliberateness and intentionality relationships require outside that bubble.

A highlight of this year was celebrating the graduations of some of my closest friends. These are the same friends with whom I studied late into the night during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, often from 9 PM to 3 or 4 AM, over Zoom. We didn‚Äôt attend the same schools and were scattered across the country, but we stayed connected, supporting each other through victories, heartbreaks, and challenges. Seeing their growth and celebrating their achievements in Austin and Nashville was deeply fulfilling. Though we don‚Äôt talk as much now, our bond remains strong, and we prioritise being present for each other‚Äôs milestones‚Äîa habit we hadn‚Äôt cultivated while in college.

Locally, I‚Äôve found joy in helping to build a small but tight-knit community in Seattle, where we go out for fun activities and hang out most weekends. Time outside work also allowed me to connect with people through soccer, pickleball, dance socials, and other activities. I‚Äôve grown closer to my roommates, who generously let me host game nights at our house. This year, I hosted two big game nights (one drew over 80 people!), my soccer team for snacks and games, and a pirate-themed Christmas party complete with a treasure hunt for Santa's lost ‚ÄúParcel of Eternal Happiness.‚Äù To my surprise, the party (and hunt) was a massive success. I was particularly proud of our giving tree, which collected supplies, toys, and gift cards for a local Seattle charity supporting women and children experiencing homelessness. Special shoutout to my friend, [Fortune](https://www.instagram.com/4tune_tellar/), for being Santa, the Captain of the North Pole Fleet, during the party. In 2025, I hope to host even more events that bring people together for fun and meaningful causes.

</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

That said, I did drop the ball on one community-building effort this year. I had formed a partnership with a local club to host events but failed to follow through with proper plans. They were enthusiastic and welcoming, and I didn‚Äôt treat that relationship with the respect it deserved. I plan to reconnect in 2025 and make amends by delivering on those opportunities.

<p align="center">

</p>

</p>

The highlight of my year, however, was when my parents visited Seattle. Spending time with them was a gift. As they approach new milestones, including my mom‚Äôs 60th birthday, I‚Äôm inspired by their unwavering energy, ambition, and commitment to learning. They‚Äôre still working toward new goals, transitioning into the next phase of their lives, and leading by example. Our relationship has grown significantly over the years. I‚Äôve moved past the anger I once held, stemming from childhood traumas I attributed to their parenting. With time, I‚Äôve come to see them as flawed, human, and deeply loving‚Äîparents who did their best with the knowledge they had. Today, I respect them more than ever and cherish the sacrifices they made for me and my sisters.

</p>

</p>

Still, I have room for growth. This year, I let certain emotional triggers get the best of me, at times unfairly channeling that intensity toward those closest to me. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not proud of, and I deeply regret the hurt it caused. I‚Äôm committed to addressing these patterns and am actively using every tool at my disposal to improve. In 2025, I aspire to be a better roommate, friend, partner, son, brother, and teammate‚Äîto bring more empathy, patience, and kindness into every relationship in my life. Steve Jobs once said, ‚ÄúSome years you win, some years you build character.‚Äù For me, 2024 was undoubtedly a year of building character that challenged me to grow, reflect, and strive toward being a better version of myself. And in 2025, the work continues.

## My Favorite Things from 2024

As I mentioned earlier, 2024 was a year of exploration‚Äîa time to immerse myself in art, music, literature, and more from various sources. I‚Äôd love to share some of the works that deeply resonated with me this year. You‚Äôll likely notice a strong bias toward World War II history, a subject that has always fascinated me with its rich stories, complexities, and lessons. It‚Äôs a personal passion that fuels much of my curiosity. This year, I also found myself drawn to country music, discovering its ability to tell heartfelt and compelling stories. These selections aren‚Äôt necessarily new releases from 2024, but they‚Äôre the ones that made a lasting impact on me. I hope you enjoy this list and perhaps find a few recommendations that spark your own interest.

A more controversial mention is Henry Ford‚Äôs [*My Life and Work*](https://a.co/d/hp4kylw). The book offers fascinating insights into Ford's business philosophy and the strategies that built one of history's most iconic automobile companies. However, its ideas are undeniably dated in many areas, and it takes a problematic turn with overt antisemitism. This led me to explore Ford‚Äôs troubling history regarding antisemitism, segregation, and his opposition to unions. [You can read more here](https://www.history.com/news/henry-ford-antisemitism-worker-treatment). While the book contains valuable lessons, I recommend approaching it critically, applying only its timeless principles while acknowledging its serious flaws.

## What am I Looking Forward to in 2025

As 2025 approaches, I‚Äôve been mulling over several goals. I‚Äôve already mentioned some; I‚Äôm still fine-tuning others to ensure they‚Äôre realistic and meaningful. I aim to dedicate more time to deep, focused work, learning, and personal projects. I desire to read at least 24 books (two per month), become a more effective communicator and storyteller, build consistent habits aligned with my aspirations, and maintain a sense of optimism‚Äîliving with a positive mindset, laughter and a smile, even when challenges arise. Physically, I plan to focus on hypertrophy training and light running early in the year, shifting toward heavy running and training for a half-marathon personal record in the fall.

But enough about me‚Äî2025 promises to bring plenty of exciting things. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most looking forward to:

- **Books**

In this book, the inventor of the World Wide Web tells the story of his groundbreaking invention and its global impact.

As a fan of story-driven adventure games, I also hope for more news about Naughty Dog‚Äôs [Intergalactic](https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement).

- **Other Goals**

In addition to the exciting releases and plans already mentioned, I have a few broader goals for 2025. I aim to deepen my cybersecurity knowledge and cultivate technical skills and expertise that align with my interests and aspirations in business, leadership, and entrepreneurship. On a personal level, I want to focus on building more profound, meaningful relationships and continuing to improve my emotional intelligence and resilience.

When it comes to reading, I‚Äôm looking forward to delving into timeless works like [Mere Christianity](https://a.co/d/9c5X5NL) by C. S. Lewis‚Äîpurely for the joy of it‚Äîand revisiting classics like [A Farewell to Arms](https://a.co/d/jiiPAbe) by [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002133/). I also plan to explore books like [Hit Refresh](https://a.co/d/8gxFXHN) by [Satya Nadella](https://news.microsoft.com/exec/satya-nadella/), among others that I‚Äôll undoubtedly discover as the year unfolds. Depending on what captivates me, I‚Äôll share more about these in my reflections at the end of 2025.

Another area of interest is the blog [Hardcore Software: Learning by Shipping](https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/) by [Steven Sinofsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sinofsky/). Sinofsky‚Äôs insights into the challenges and triumphs of leading massive software projects‚Äîlike Microsoft Office, Windows 7, and Windows 8‚Äîare invaluable for anyone striving to set ambitious goals and execute them effectively. I hope to glean valuable lessons for shipping products on time and achieving ambitious outcomes.

As the year progresses, I look forward to discovering new books, projects, and experiences that inspire growth, spark creativity, and enrich my understanding of the world.
