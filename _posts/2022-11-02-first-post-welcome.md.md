## welcome

I don't know where this would take me. I started this blog because I use WhatsApp a lot, and on WhatsApp, I share a lot on my status updates. I could share those thoughts and ideas on a blog instead.

I am looking forward to where the journey takes me.

Similarly, I think this will be good for me. Because I do feel lonely a lot, and I struggle with being alone. This is surprising because I always wanted to be left alone while I grew up. But perhaps, you could say, things and times change. I came to college and discovered that I struggle with anxiety (including physical symptoms like chest and stomach pain) and dread being alone.

So, in those precious and quite lonely hours, I could gain insights and share them on this blog.

Other things I intend to do are:

- master computer science concepts
- master mathematical concepts
- read a lot of books and engage with diverse ideas

I would share my thoughts and insights as I walk that journey.

If you found this blog, I hope you find it interesting enough to continue reading. And if you read it, I hope it was meaningful enough that you return. If not, this is an outlet for me, and I can't wait to see how useful (or not so beneficial) it might be for me.
