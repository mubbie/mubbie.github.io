## welcome

**Welcome to my blog**, a new chapter in my life. I am starting this blog because I use WhatsApp a lot, and on WhatsApp, I share my thoughts through status updates. I could share those ideas on a blog instead. A blog is less fleeting, and I would have more characters to work with. 

I am still determining where this would take me, but I look forward to the adventure. 

Writing more will also be good for me. Why? Because I do feel lonely a lot. This is surprising because I always wanted to be left alone while I grew up. Solitude was my sanctuary. I remember when I was in high school. It was a boarding school, and I was the study prefect, so I had the keys to the library. Over the weekends, I would lock myself in there to be alone and undisturbed. 

However, things and times have changed. I came to college and quickly discovered that I feel anxious a lot (including physical symptoms like intense chest and stomach pain), and I dread being alone. Even worse, I am slowly learning that several of the experiences I had growing up were incredibly traumatic, and they have contributed, in some not-so-great ways, to how I act as an adult. 

So, part of my current goals are sorting out those issues, attacking my deepest fears, and slowly conquering anxiety. When I'm calm and collected, my thoughts and actions align more harmoniously, making life significantly more enjoyable (even when times are tough). What I need to handle better are those scary hours when the anxiety comes up and reason goes down. Then I feel that strong pull in my chest, and I rapidly swing into strong flight or acute fright. In those moments, I could attempt to glean some insight and put down some thought. Perhaps I can turn the dread into fountains of inspiration and calm. 

Other things I intend to do are:
- master computer science concepts (including Machine Learning)
- work towards being an excellent security engineer
- master mathematical concepts
- read a lot of books and engage with diverse ideas
- take on meaningful challenges and enjoy this beauty that is life

I would share my thoughts and insights as I walk the journey.

If you found this blog, I hope you find it interesting enough to continue reading. And if you read it, I hope it was meaningful enough that you return. If not, this is an outlet for me, and I can't wait to see how useful (or not so beneficial) it might be for me.
