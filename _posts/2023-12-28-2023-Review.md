## 2023

2023, what a year. A lot happened this year. Most significant include the following: 
- I graduated from college. You can watch my commencement [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTis3jXH45k). I graduated as my Senior Class President, with high honors, an engineering degree in Computer Engineering, and a Bachelor of Arts.
- My parents came all the way from Nigeria during my graduation. They were in the US for six weeks, and it was a wonderful time of reunion after four long years.
- I started working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.
- I am also spending more time working on Lena, a contextualized learning management system for Nigerian schools. This year, we raised $15,000 in grant funding:
  - $10,000 from Ozy Media/AT&T. You can learn about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zyVbMHVgjM). This award was through Ozy Media Genius Awards, but their CEO had [some issues with the DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ozy-media-and-its-founder-carlos-watson-indicted-years-long-multi-million-dollar-fraud) earlier this year, so AT&T covered the award.
  - $5,000 for winning the Founders' Grant at the Magnuson Center of Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth. You can read about it [here](https://magnuson.dartmouth.edu/blog/2023/07/06/founders-grants-funnel-more-than-12000-to-dartmouth-led-enterprises/)
